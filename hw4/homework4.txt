The tapes you'd need to restore the file system are all the files from Jan 15 to Jan 21.
The good thing about having this many incremental backups is that it is much easier to restore the file system.
The downside to having this many incremental backups is that you would have to keep track of which back ups to use when restoring a file system, and it takes longer to make the back up tapes.

Given ip: 10.3.12.2
      (a) Class A
      (b) The netmask would be 255.0.0.0, and in CIDR notation /8
      (c.1) 10.3.12.1 is the default gateway ip address
      (c.2) 10.3.12.255 is the broadcast ip address
